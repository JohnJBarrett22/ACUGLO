          <p>“Corinna has such a wealth of knowledge not just in Eastern Medicine but also nutrition, fitness,  a deep understanding of psychology and how our bodies hold emotion and stress. Her ability to approach health from a multi-faceted viewpoint helped me find simple solutions to health problems traditional Western medicine Doctors had previously been unable to solve.”<br><br>‍<em>— S.S., Los Angeles</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="_3_block_padding">&quot;I&#x27;ve been a patient of TCM my whole life, and when in the right hands, acupuncture has always worked to treat my chronic pain. But there is something remarkable about the way that Corinna practices her medicine. There is depth, focus, warmth, care, and trust––to which my body responds knowingly. They are essential qualities I&#x27;d never encountered in other TCM visits until she started treating me. Corinna draws from her own experiences with illness, bringing a deeply compassionate perspective to living and healing holistically in our bodies. I highly recommend working with her; she makes the long trips from New York to LA worth it.”<br><br>‍<em>— J.L., New York</em></div>
        <div class="_3_block_padding">“I started seeing Corinna a year and a half ago and have been quite struck by her gentle spirit and effective treatments. I initially sought out acupuncture in hopes of alleviating my stress and managing pain. I have left every treatment feeling renewed. I not only experience a shift in the clinic on her treatment table, but have also taken her dietary and lifestyle recommendations to heart and applied them at home and have found immense relief. I am incredibly thankful for Corinna’s work and highly recommend her treatment.”<br>‍<br>‍<em>— J.B. Los Angeles</em></div>

        <div class="_3_block_padding">
          <p>“Corinna and her treatments have been life altering. She is caring, attentive and thoughtful. I had never seen an Eastern Medicine practitioner prior and I was blown away by the effectiveness and the relief it brought. It was both a physical and emotional experience that has left an indelible mark for which I continue to be thankful for.“<br><br>‍<em>—E.B., Los Angeles</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="_3_block_padding">“With every visit, Corinna has been thoughtful, empathetic and thorough in her assessments and treatments, taking care to explain what she’s doing and why. I always leave a session with Corinna feeling more balanced, like I’ve done something good for myself, and with more knowledge of how to care for myself in a better way.”<br><br>‍<em>— C.P., Los Angeles</em></div>
        <div class="_3_block_padding">&quot;My session with Corinna was one of the most cathartic releases I’ve experienced-for body, mind and spirit. She asked the most insightful questions about the issues I was having. She was so incredibly intuitive that she understood how to work on healing those issues, and then unearthed and healed some that had become entirely hidden from me! I am so grateful for the knowledge and expertise that Corinna has, and can’t wait for my next session!”<br><br>‍<em>— K.A., New York</em></div>
